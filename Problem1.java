//Given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.
//        Examples:
//
//Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]
//Output : 5
//
//
//Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]
//Output : 7


//approach is to use tweaked binarySearch
//the base case here is that if we want to find missing number between 2 no ->  [5,7] ->5+7/2->6 this will be our result base case
